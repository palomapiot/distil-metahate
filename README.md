## Overview 🌟

This project presents a **Llama-3-8B-Distil-MetaHate** a Llama 3 8B distilled model designed for hate speech explanation and classification. By utilizing **Chain-of-Thought** methodologies, we aim to enhance the interpretability and operational efficiency of hate speech detection systems.

This work was accepted at the 47th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2025). Paper soon! 📄
